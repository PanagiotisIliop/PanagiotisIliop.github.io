            <div class="u-align-justify u-blog-control u-post-content u-text u-text-2 fr-view"><p id="isPasted" style="text-align: justify;">Here are a few lessons I learned after intense studying for 5+ years in the school of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens, one of the highest-ranked engineering schools in Greece. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">1. Self-learning is the best way to learn.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Self-learning is the most valuable skill that all engineers acquire during their studies. It is a skill that will accompany you daily, every time you want to learn something new or address a problem, not only in engineering-related subjects but in every field of your life. In my opinion, it is the defining characteristic that separates successful engineering schools from the rest.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">2. If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, take others with you.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In most cases, the acquisition of knowledge is a long-term and intensive process. That's why I advise taking others with you. While you are in college, engage socially, spend time with others and keep the people with whom you share the same vision and ideas close to you. They are the ones who are going to support and motivate you throughout your studies. They are going to make the boring afternoon lectures more fun and exciting. Although sometimes it would be wise to address some challenges alone to gain confidence, harden up, and learn about yourself in a more profound manner.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">3. Lack of focus is the worst enemy of today's engineers.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The world we live in is full of distractions. Most of them are subtle, and we don't even realize we've become addicted to them until it's too late. That comes with a severe impact on our ability to focus for an extended period of time on a complicated task. I myself encountered this problem, and I still do, but by the time I realized that and started working on it and slowly got better. The most important step to address the lack of focus is to realize that you suffer from it. After that, self-educate yourself on what is needed to overcome this and start working towards that direction. If you can not see any noticeable results after a rational period of time, ask for help, It is not a shame.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">4. Results matter, accuracy matters.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Many of us are familiar with the saying, "It's the effort, not the results, that matter." While this may be acceptable for children, this is not the case for adults, especially engineers. Accurate results are extremely important. Minor errors can have significant consequences in engineering, including financial costs and even loss of life. Therefore, it is vital to strive for perfection when possible, and a second opinion from a trustworthy engineer can always be valuable. However, whenever a mistake happens, take ownership of what you are accounted for, learn from it, and move forward.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">5. Enjoy the journey as much as the destination&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It may sound cliche, but many people, especially engineering students, tend to forget this during prolonged periods of intense studying and challenging exams. Of course, you will feel happy and relieved when you earn your degree. However, you will always look back on the struggles of being a student, such as striving to finish assignments on time with your classmates or focusing on a single task without any other distractions while studying at home and smiling.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">+. Quality over quantity.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">If you have made it to the end of this, here's a bonus tip for you: In today's world, it's common for people to share their successes and the hard work they put in to achieve their goals on social media. For example, Elon Musk claims to work more than 120 hours per week and sleep less than 6 hours a day. While it may be possible for some people to maintain this level of work and sleep, it's not realistic or healthy for most people. It's important to prioritize your health by getting enough sleep, eating nutritious meals, and staying active. When you're feeling burnt out from studying or working, take a break, get some sunlight, hydrate, and spend time with friends. By establishing healthy habits, you'll be able to maintain productivity and efficiency in the long run. Pushing yourself to the limit with excessive work and long hours may give you a temporary boost, but it will ultimately lead to burnout.</p></div><!--/blog_post_content-->
